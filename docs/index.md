# Introduction

Frontile is a modern, accessible, and extensible component library for Ember.js applications. Built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/), Frontile provides the building blocks you need to create consistent, beautiful, and accessible user interfaces while following best practices from the Ember.js community.

import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { Button } from 'frontile';

export default class Example extends Component {
  onPress = () => {
    alert('Welcome to Frontile!');
  };

  <template>
    <Button @intent='primary' @size='lg' @onPress={{this.onPress}}>
      Get Started
    </Button>
  </template>
}
```

Frontile draws inspiration from the excellent work of many frontend component libraries and design systems. We're grateful to these projects for paving the way and establishing patterns that make building accessible, beautiful user interfaces possible:

- **[HeroUI](https://www.heroui.com/)** ‚Äì Modern React UI library with excellent accessibility and theming
- **[IntentUI](https://intentui.com/)** ‚Äì Design system focused on developer experience and component composition
- **[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)** ‚Äì Full-featured React components library with comprehensive theming
